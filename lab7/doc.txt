ASCII - Acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a 
character encoding standard that assigns a unique numerical value to all 
characters including special symbols.

The ASCII standard was introduced to streamline the sharing of information 
between different languages, systems and compilers. ASCII code for a character, 
say A, is a unique sequence of bits stored in memory instead of A itself.(ASCII code for A is 65)

Each ASCII code occupies 7 bits in memory and each character is assigned a value ranging 
from 0 to 127.(128 total characters)
